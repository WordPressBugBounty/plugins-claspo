> ***Claspo solved our customization needs with lead generation***
> *What I like most about Claspo is the ease of customizing the design, value propositions based on customer segments, and display rules of lead capture widgets. With Claspo, we can create user-friendly pop-ups and set specific trigger scenarios, something HubSpot forms couldn‚Äôt do, and all without costly development. Claspo also lets us segment leads and we have greatly improved our follow-up processes. The mobile optimization feature was a nice surprise, and customer support made it even easier to fine-tune our pop-ups for mobile users.*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Conversion Drivers###
We constantly improve the Claspo popup builder by adding more components to help you solve any task. Here are just a few of our released features to help you grow email lists and increase sales. 

**Gamification üéÆ**

Claspo‚Äôs [gamified pop-ups](https://claspo.io/templates/use-case/gamification/) create exciting, share-worthy interactions that increase engagement, leading to a 400% increase in opt-ins.

Our interactive options:

* <strong>Spin to Win</strong> üé° ‚Äì add excitement with a mini lottery-style wheel that entices visitors to share their emails for a chance to get prize. Spin the wheel pop-ups drive conversions by over 41% compared to countdown timers!

* <strong>Scratch Card</strong> üÉè ‚Äì perfect for mobile-first campaigns. This gamified experience lets users scratch away to reveal a prize, increasing conversions by up to 300%.

* <strong>Gift Box</strong> üéÅ ‚Äì capture visitors‚Äô attention with hidden rewards they can ‚Äòopen‚Äô, achieving a 3x conversion increase over standard email opt-in form.

<strong>Manage prizes and probabilities</strong>
Claspo lets you set winning probabilities and assign promo codes effortlessly. For example, define the reward structure for your Spin Wheel widget: 50% chance for 5% off, 25% for 10% off, 15% for 15% off, and 10% for free shipping.

**Dynamic Text Roller üî†** 

Say goodbye to static pop-ups with Claspo‚Äôs text roller! This feature lets you display rotating messages, like discounts, free shipping, or product bundle offers, ensuring visitors see all your key deals without cluttering the design.

Moving text catches the eye, drawing users to your content instead of scrolling past. It‚Äôs perfect for ecommerce campaigns ‚Äì keep content fresh by rotating promotions during Black Friday promotion, Cyber Monday, other holiday sales and limited-time marketing events.

**[Slider](https://claspo.io/templates/use-case/slider/) ‚è©üñºÔ∏è**

Don't irritate your visitors with multiple pop-ups for different offers.

* Include as many images or videos as you want in one pop-up.
* Promote multiple deals or products.
* Showcase different ways to use a single item.
* Demonstrate new functionality and more.
&nbsp;

**Multi Step Form üî¢üìù**

Multistep form adds an element of interactivity and helps break down complex information into manageable parts.

Instead of asking for detailed information all at once, use multi-step forms to: 

* first gather basic details like name and email,
* then ask about preferences or interests,
* finally collect any additional information, such as demographics.

This approach makes it easier for users to engage without feeling overwhelmed.

**Relative Countdown Timer ‚è±Ô∏è**

Based on our customer experience, a valuable offer strengthened with a countdown timer and a strong call to action can increase CR by 112%. Benefit even more from the FOMO effect with our Relative [countdown timer widgets](https://claspo.io/templates/use-case/timer/).

* Starts for each visitor individually, ensuring everyone gets a fair shot at your offer.
* As soon as the time reaches zero for one visitor, the offer disappears for them but remains visible to others.

**Promo codes üéüÔ∏è**

* Display the promo code directly on the widget after a conversion action, such as filling out a newsletter subscription form, instead of sending it to the inbox. This keeps visitors on the site and encourages them to complete the main conversion.

* Set widgets to pop up only for new visitors to attract new shoppers without overspending on discounts.

**[Exit-Intent Survey](https://claspo.io/templates/use-case/conduct-exit-intent-servey/) üìã**

* Go a step further than the usual ‚ÄòHold on‚Äô by asking users why they are leaving your site.
* Get valuable insights into usability, product assortment, and other key areas. This is much more than the information provided by an NPS form.

> ***Essential tool for growth***
> *The exemplary feature of Claspo is its seamless integration with our other solutions. Its utility is particularly pronounced in facilitating review acquisition via their exit-intent pop-ups. This allowed us to quickly gather the necessary info for further improvement of our services.*

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Targeting Triggers for Personalized CX###

You can configure the widget placement on your website and set display conditions without needing developers.

**Identifying Newcomers**

Showcase WordPress popup exclusively to new visitors. 
<strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Welcome newcomers with a special offer, encourage them to fill out an email subscription form, or introduce them to your company or product with an engaging video.

**Geotargeting**

Ensure your message reaches the right audience in the right place. Tailor your widgets to specific audiences ‚Äî from entire countries to regions and even cities. 
<strong>Pro Tip</strong>: This solution is ideal for lead generation forms for local events, etc.

[youtube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmoCqcqcq9g]

**UTM-targeting**

Set widgets to display based on UTM tags. 

*Example:* a rule will trigger a specific pop-up with a relevant offer if a person visits your website through an email, social media campaign or PPC ad banner with a specific UTM tag. This personalization enhances the user experience and increases the likelihood that the visitor will convert into a buyer. 

**Behavioral Triggers**

Customize widget activation based on user behavior, such as:

* time spent on a site or page,
* scrolling depth,
* number of pages viewed,
* inactivity,
* exit intent.

###  5Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Rules for Non Intrusive Popup Display ###
Great deals and valuable content are key, but bombarding visitors with them can backfire. To avoid this, Claspo offers high-end approaches that other pop-up tools lack.

**Silence Interval**

Be sure that your visitors can focus on your content without feeling overwhelmed.

* The default time gap between widget displays in Claspo is 3 minutes.
* Easily adjust it based on typical user behavior on your site ensuring a smooth browsing experience.

**Overlapping Protection**

Managing multiple widgets can be complicated. Claspo's automatic overlapping protection eliminates the worry of them clashing on your visitors' screens, even if you duplicate display rules for several widgets by mistake.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Reliable WordPress Plugin with Wide Integration Options###
The Claspo popup generator will not conflict with your other plugins. Also we guarantee there will be no bugs after updating your WordPress version. Our widgets do not slow down the website and respond to triggers with a lightning speed of 200 milliseconds.

> ***We can‚Äôt go back to making popups without Claspo***
> *The lack of negative impact on page speed was a huge relief. Claspo offered so much functionality without compromising performance.*

**Step 1: Select the Perfect Template**

Choose a ready-made template created by Claspo experienced designers or make one from scratch. Using filters such as use case, layout, industry, and theme, you can choose the template that best suits your needs, whether you're wondering how to get email lists for marketing or running sales campaigns.

**Step 2: Customize the Template for Your Brand**

Choose a color scheme that matches your brand book or website style. Write text and change images by adding your own or selecting from our library.

<strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Add elements and fields that can increase conversions:

* <strong>Gamified</strong> components to grow mailing list while driving the primary conversion;

* <strong>Promo code</strong> and <strong>countdown timer</strong> to drive sales, optins and event registrations;

* A <strong>checkbox</strong> and a <strong>dropdown</strong> in a newsletter signup form for the initial segmentation of subscribers or in a survey;

* A <strong>video</strong> or <strong>slider</strong> with multiple images to increase engagement and, once again, sales.

**Step 3: Set the Rules for Displaying the Widget**

The optimal rules for displaying pop-ups are set in the system by default. However, you can customize them to meet your specific needs and objectives. For example, choose to show the widget only to newcomers or residents of a selected city, etc.

**Step 4: Integrate Claspo with Marketing Automation Software**

For example, you can add integration with your ESP with a couple of clicks. Copy a single line of code from our system and add it to the admin panel of your email marketing automation platform. You won't need this step for all your future widgets.

**Step 5: Final Touches**

You can test drive the completed widget without publishing it on your website. If everything is fine, publish it and track conversions and revenue! To improve performance, A/B test different versions of your lead gen form or other widget. Our built-in testing solution helps you quickly learn what motivates your target audience to convert.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

# What's Included in the Free Claspo Plan?
Claspo's fair free plan provides everything you need to get started with pop-ups on your website:

* Three active widgets. You can create and use up to three pop-up widgets on your website at any given time. This allows you to test different pop-up designs and target them to specific audiences.
* 30,000 pageviews per month. This is suitable for new websites and those with moderate traffic. If you exceed this limit, you can purchase additional pageviews without upgrading your plan.
* Access to Claspo‚Äôs full range of features and templates. 

# How are Pageviews Calculated?
Pageviews refer to the number of times a user visits the pages where the Claspo script is installed.

The Claspo tracking module counts a pageview whenever a page is loaded or the URL path (the segments before the question mark) changes. For instance, if a user navigates to a different page and then returns to the original page, each visit is counted as a separate pageview. Additionally, if a user reloads a page, it counts as an additional pageview.

However, a pageview is not counted when only the query component of a page URL changes (the part after the question mark). For example, if a user applies or changes filters on your page and the URL path remains the same, this does not count as a new pageview.

# Is There an Expiration Date on the Free Plan?
No! Claspo's free plan is truly free for life. There are no hidden fees or time constraints. You can use it for as long as it meets your needs. 

Whether you're a solo entrepreneur just starting out or a small business looking to test the waters of pop-up marketing, the free plan is a great place to begin. It allows you to experiment with Claspo's features and see the positive impact pop-ups can have on your website's performance at your own pace. 

If your website grows or you need more advanced features, you can always upgrade to a paid plan later.

# How Can I Save Money on Claspo‚Äôs Paid Plans?
Claspo rewards your commitment! Choose the annual plan and get 2 extra months of service free.

# Can I Cancel My Subscription?
Yes, you can! Claspo offers full flexibility. You can cancel your subscription anytime from within your account settings.

# How Does Claspo Handle User Data?
This plugin utilizes the [Claspo](https://claspo.io) service to enhance your website's user experience by enabling features such as popups for email capture, lead generation, notifications, and surveys. Claspo provides a platform for creating and managing these web widgets.

To understand how Claspo handles user data collected on your website, please refer to our [Data Processing Agreement](https://claspo.io/data-processing-agreement/), [Terms of Use](https://claspo.io/terms-of-use/), and [Privacy Policy](https://claspo.io/privacy-policy/).
